We address effects of laser intensity, pulse duration and in the case of of alignment on photoelectron momentum distributions (PMDs). In the long pulse limit, as expected from a simple classical picture, the PMDs of H and of aligned perpendicular to the polarization plane show a three-fold symmetry imposed by the bicircular laser field. Compared with the expectation for the positions of the peaks in this three-fold structure, we observe off-set angles that depend on the photoelectron energy as well as the laser intensity. For , the symmetry in the PMDs is broken by the anisotropic molecular potential at molecular alignment not perpendicular to the plane of laser polarization. In the short pulse limit, the PMDs are sensitive to the carrier envelope phase of the laser field.}

	abstract = {The wave nature of particles is rarely observed, in part because of their very short de Broglie wavelengths in most situations. However, even with wavelengths close to the size of their surroundings, the particles couple to their environment (for example, by gravity, Coulomb interaction, or thermal radiation). These couplings shift the wave phases, often in an uncontrolled way, and the resulting decoherence, or loss of phase integrity, is thought to be a main cause of the transition from quantum to classical behavior. How much interaction is needed to induce this transition? Here we show that a photoelectron and two protons form a minimum particle/slit system and that a single additional electron constitutes a minimum environment. Interference fringes observed in the angular distribution of a single electron are lost through its Coulomb interaction with a second electron, though the correlated momenta of the entangled electron pair continue to exhibit quantum interference.},

These fields are made by combining an elliptically polarized fundamental, typically in the infrared range, with its counter-rotating second harmonic. Here we present a theoretical study of the harmonic emission from the chiral molecule propylene oxide in bi-elliptical fields. Our calculations include, for the first time in such a complex system, accurate photorecomination matrix elements, evaluated using the static-exchange density functional theory method. We show that bi-elliptical light can induce strong chiral dichroism in the harmonic spectra of chiral molecules in a broad range of harmonic numbers and ellipticities.}

An electron recollision model in a rotating frame at rotating frequency predicts this simple result as a result of recollision dynamics in a combination of bichromatic circularly polarized pulses.

The numerically calculated ionization ratios of the and orbitals agree well with the theoretical results (i.e., the counter-rotating electron tunnels more easily). However, for strong laser pulses and low laser frequencies, the adiabatic laser-dressed orbitals play an important role. In a Floquet treatment of a three-level model, we find that in this regime the ionization ratio of initial and orbitals depends strongly on the orbital energy order of valence s and orbitals. We also show that the emission angles of valence and electrons are different and should be observable in attoclock experiments.}

abstract = "Nonsequential double ionization of Ar by a counter-rotating two-color circularly polarized laser field is theoretically investigated. At the combined intensity in the “knee” structure range, the double ionization occurs mainly through recollision induced excitation followed by subsequent ionization of Ar+∗. By tracing the history of the recollision trajectories, we explain how the relative intensity ratio of the two colors controls the correlated electron dynamics and optimizes the ionization yields. The major channels contributing to enhancing the double ionization are through the elliptical trajectories with smaller travel time but not through the triangle shape or the other long cycle trajectories. Furthermore, the correlated electron dynamics could be limited to the attosecond time scale by adjusting the relative intensity ratio. Finally, the double ionization from doubly excited complex at low laser intensity is qualitatively discussed."

Although the resulting circularly polarized harmonics consist of relatively simple pairs of peaks in the spectral domain, in the time domain, the field is predicted to emerge as a complex series of rotating linearly polarized bursts, varying rapidly in amplitude, frequency, and polarization. We extend attosecond metrology techniques to circularly polarized light by simultaneously irradiating a copper surface with circularly polarized high-harmonic and linearly polarized infrared laser fields. The resulting temporal modulation of the photoelectron spectra carries essential phase information about the EUV field. Utilizing the polarization selectivity of the solid surface and by rotating the circularly polarized EUV field in space, we fully retrieve the amplitude and phase of the circularly polarized harmonics, allowing us to reconstruct one of the most complex coherent light fields produced to date.},

Cross-phase modulation of the light in a hollow waveguide produced a bandwidth of 16??nm, with a center frequency of 270??nm, at 1??kHz. A simple grating pair was used to compress the pulses to a duration of 8??fs, as measured by self-diffraction frequency-resolved optical gating. In the experiment the compressed energy was greater than 1 ?J, with a peak power of \&gt;100 MW; the technique can be scaled to higher energy. Further improvements should make it possible to generate pulses as short as ?3 fs with this technique.},

	abstract = {We predict high-order harmonics in which the polarization within the spectral bandwidth of each harmonic varies with frequency continuously and significantly. For example, the interaction of counter-rotating circularly-polarized bichromatic drivers having close central frequencies with isotropic gas leads to the emission of polarization-fan harmonics where each harmonic in the spectrum has the following property: it is nearly circularly-polarized in one tail of the harmonic peak, linear in the center of the peak and nearly circular with the opposite helicity in the opposite tail. Also, we show that polarization-fan high harmonics with modulated ellipticity are obtained when elliptical drivers are used. Polarization-fan harmonics are obtained as a result of multiple (at least two) head-on recollisions of electrons with their parent ions occurring from different angles in a two-dimensional plane. The use of bichromatic drivers with close central frequencies largely preserves the single-cycle, single-atom and macroscopic physics of ‘ordinary’ high harmonic generation, where both the driver and high harmonics are linearly polarized. Thus, it should offer several attracting features, including (i) a direct route for extending the maximal photon energy of observed helical high harmonics to keV by using bichromatic drivers only in the mid-IR region and (ii) utilizing phase matching methods that were developed for ‘ordinary’ high harmonic generation driven by quasi-monochromatic pulses (e.g. pressure tuning phase matching). These polarization-fan harmonics may be utilized for exploring non-repetitive ultrafast chiral phenomena, e.g. dynamics of magnetic domains, in a single shot.}

The ionization probability in the combined fields depends on both the frequency of the attosecond pulse and the time delay between both pulses, since the IR field periodically shifts SA-pulse-excited energy levels into and out of resonance.}

	Abstract = {The generation of ultrashort pulses is a key to exploring the dynamic behaviour of matter on ever-shorter timescales. Recent developments have pushed the duration of laser pulses close to its natural limit---the wave cycle, which lasts somewhat longer than one femtosecond (1 fs = 10-15 s) in the visible spectral range. Time-resolved measurements with these pulses are able to trace dynamics of molecular structure, but fail to capture electronic processes occurring on an attosecond (1 as = 10-18 s) timescale. Here we trace electronic dynamics with a time resolution of ≤150 as by using a subfemtosecond soft-X-ray pulse and a few-cycle visible light pulse. Our measurement indicates an attosecond response of the atomic system, a soft-X-ray pulse duration of 650 $\pm$150 as and an attosecond synchronism of the soft-X-ray pulse with the light field. The demonstrated experimental tools and techniques open the door to attosecond spectroscopy of bound electrons.},

At moderate intensity, the momentum distribution of the two electrons shows a maximum in the middle of each side of the triangle of the negative vector potential. At high intensity, the momentum distribution exhibits a double-triangle structure, which is attributed to the different values of the laser intensity where the two electrons are released after recollision. At low intensity, the momentum distribution shows a shift deviating from the middle of the side of the triangle of the negative vector potential. This is because the first electrons are emitted within a narrow time window after the field maximum. In addition, at low intensity, double-recollision events and NSDI originating from doubly excited states induced by recollision are prevalent.},

ABSTRACT = {We theoretically study the photoelectron angular distribution (PAD) from the two-photon single ionization of H and He by femtosecond and attosecond extreme-ultraviolet pulses, based on the time-dependent perturbation theory and simulations with the full time-dependent Schrodinger equation. The PAD is formed by the interference of the s and d continuum wave packets, and, thus, contains the information on the relative phase and amplitude ratio between them. We find that, when a spectrally broadened femtosecond pulse is resonant with an excited level, the PAD substantially changes with pulse width, since the competition between resonant and nonresonant ionization paths, leading to  distinct from the scattering phase shift difference, changes with it. In contrast, when the Rydberg manifold is excited, and for the case of above-threshold two-photon ionization, and the PAD do not depend much on pulse width, except for the attosecond region. Thus, the Rydberg manifold and the continuum behave similarly in this respect. For a high-harmonic pulse composed of multiple harmonic orders, while the value is different from that for a single-component pulse, the PAD still rapidly varies with pulse width. The present results illustrate a new way to tailor the continuum wave packet.},

Energies of 1S-states are also calculated for those having nuclear charge in the range 14 ≤ Z ≤ 92. The calculation of the coupling potential matrix elements of the two-body potentials has been simplified by the use of Raynal–Revai Coefficients (RRC). The three-body wave function in the Schrödinger equation when expanded in terms of hyperspherical harmonics (HH), leads to an infinite set of coupled differential equation (CDE) which for practical purposes is truncated to a finite set and the truncated set of CDE’s are solved by renormalized Numerov method (RNM) to get the energy (E). The calculated energy is compared with the ones of the literature. }

	Abstract = {Circularly-polarized extreme ultraviolet and X-ray radiation is useful for analysing the structural, electronic and magnetic properties of materials. To date, such radiation has only been available at large-scale X-ray facilities such as synchrotrons. Here, we demonstrate the first bright, phase-matched, extreme ultraviolet circularly-polarized high harmonics source. The harmonics are emitted when bi-chromatic counter-rotating circularly-polarized laser pulses field-ionize a gas in a hollow-core waveguide. We use this new light source for magnetic circular dichroism measurements at the M-shell absorption edges of Co. We show that phase-matching of circularly-polarized harmonics is unique and robust, producing a photon flux comparable to linearly polarized high harmonic sources. This work represents a critical advance towards the development of table-top systems for element-specific imaging and spectroscopy of multiple elements simultaneously in magnetic and other chiral media with very high spatial and temporal resolution.},

	Abstract = {High harmonic radiation, produced when intense laser pulses interact with matter, is composed of a train of attosecond pulses. Individual pulses in this train carry information on ultrafast dynamics that vary from one half-optical-cycle to the next. Here, we demonstrate an all-optical photonic streaking measurement that provides direct experimental access to each attosecond pulse by mapping emission time onto propagation angle. This is achieved by inducing an ultrafast rotation of the instantaneous laser wavefront at the focus. We thus time-resolve attosecond pulse train generation, and hence the dynamics in the nonlinear medium itself. We apply photonic streaking to harmonic generation in gases and directly observe, for the first time, the influence of non-adiabatic electron dynamics and plasma formation on the generated attosecond pulse train. These experimental and numerical results also provide the first evidence of the generation of attosecond lighthouses in gases, which constitute ideal sources for attosecond pump--probe spectroscopy.},

	abstract = {For the last ten years, the production of polarised electrons has been of increasing interest in different fields of physics. One of the methods used to obtain polarised electron beams is based on the multiphoton ionisation of heavy alkali-metal atoms. The authors give a systematic analysis of the theoretical tools necessary for the study of the experimental quantities which can be measured in multiphoton ionisation experiments for moderate intensities in the non-resonant region. They use a description of the problem based on the density operator. The expansion of this density operator over the complete set of irreducible spherical tensor operators enables them to describe the different parameters attainable by experiments and so to construct the density matrix. This formalism allows the authors to study the total transition probabilities, the angular distributions and the differential polarisation degrees along any direction. They use the quantum defect theory as an atomic model. The atomic core polarisation is fully taken into account. The infinite summations running over the whole unperturbed atomic spectrum (discrete plus continuum) related to time dependent perturbation theory are performed using the Green's function formalism.}

abstract = {Phase matching in high-harmonic generation leads to enhancement of multiple harmonics. It is sometimes desired to control the spectral structure within the phase-matched spectral region. We propose a scheme for selective suppression of high-order harmonics within the phase-matched spectral region while weakly influencing the other harmonics. The method is based on addition of phase-mismatched segments within a phase-matched medium. We demonstrate the method numerically in two examples. First, we show that one phase-mismatched segment can significantly suppress harmonic orders 9, 15, and 21. Second, we show that two phase-mismatched segments can efficiently suppress circularly polarized harmonics with one helicity over the other when driven by a bi-circular field. The new method may be useful for various applications, including the generation of highly helical bright attosecond pulses.},

abstract = {With the semiclassical ensemble model, we systematically investigate the correlated electron dynamics in strong-field nonsequential double ionization (NSDI) by the counter-rotating circularly polarized two-color (CPTC) laser pulses. Our results show that the angular distributions of the electrons in NSDI sensitively depend on the intensity ratio of the CPTC laser fields. At the small ratio, the electron pairs emit with a relative angle of about 120{\textdegree}, and this angle shifts to 40{\textdegree} as the ratio increases and finally it exhibits a wide range distribution as the intensity ratio further increases. Back analysis of the NSDI trajectories shows that this behavior results from the relative-intensity-dependence of the release time of the electron pairs in the CPTC laser fields. The release times of the electron pairs are directly mapped to the angular distribution. Our results indicate that the emission times of the correlated electrons in NSDI can be controlled with the CPTC laser fields.},

Using a discrete time-dependent symmetry analysis, we show how all the features (harmonic order and polarization) of spectra can be explained and predicted. The symmetry analysis is generic and can easily be applied to other target and/or field configurations.}

Laser and harmonic fields are decomposed in the components having opposite helicities. Using the conservation laws for energy and projection of the total angular momentum of atom and laser and harmonic photons on the z axis we have derived a general selection rule. This rule reduces to the known result in the case of bicircular field which consists of two counter-rotating circularly polarized fields. We apply our results to explain recent experiment by Fleischer et al 2014 (Nature Photonics 8 543).}

For the s ground state of an atom, the polarization of generated pulses is close to linear, with three different orientations per cycle. However, for the p ground state of the inert gases used in the experiments, the polarization of the attosecond pulses is close to elliptical. We show that this is caused by the different intensities of the high harmonics of the opposite helicity.},

At zero delay a visibility of (0.63 {\textpm} 0.04) is measured. The delay of one partial beam reveals a coherence time of 6 fs at 23.9 nm. The visibility further displays a non-monotonic decay, which can be rationalized by the presence of multiple pulse structure.},

Within the lowest non-vanishing order of perturbation theory, two-photon double ionization, for photon energies from 42.5 to 46.5 eV, is found to be about 10% that of single ionization. It is also found that electron correlation in the final state tends to lower the amount of double ionization in comparison to predictions involving incomplete or no correlation. The potential of the approach in the context of further open problems is also discussed.}

abstract = {A general numerical approach is described that allows obtaining model sets of temporal pulse shapes of free-electron lasers (FELs) operating in the self-amplified spontaneous emission mode. Based on a random partial-coherence approach, sets of pulse shapes can be calculated that satisfy statistical criteria of FEL light predicted by established FEL theory. Importantly, the numerically retrieved sets of pulses reproduce the experimentally accessible FEL light characteristics as measured at the Free-electron LASer at Hamburg (FLASH), such as the average spectrum, single-shot spectral shape, and pulse duration. The high-precision agreement with the experimental average spectral shape, without further knowledge of FEL machine parameters, makes this approach a convenient tool for the analysis and theoretical modeling of nonlinear optical or pump\&\#x2013;probe experiments with FEL light.},

The method is based on the split-step technique where the wavefunction is expanded in the appropriate eigenfunctions for the partial operators, making the time integration efficient, accurate and simple. The fast Fourier transform is applied to produce the expansion in the hyperradial direction, and a general hyperspherical harmonics transformation is applied to create an expansion in the angular directions. The latter transformation is set up by a combination of spherical harmonics and Jacobi polynomials. The method is ideal to describe correlated ionization dynamics of two-electron systems in strong fields and other phenomena where a hyperradial expansion is efficient.}

The intensity dependence of the harmonic signal shows an interesting behaviour of the 13th harmonic, namely an initial suppression followed by a strong enhancement at 85 TW cm-2, which exceeds the magnitude of the 11th harmonic. This behaviour is a consequence of a resonant atomic process. Numerical calculations were also performed. They partly reproduced the experiment.}

	title = {Recoil-ion and electron momentum spectroscopy: reaction-microscopes},
	journal = {Reports on Progress in Physics},
	abstract = {Recoil-ion and electron momentum spectroscopy is a rapidly developing technique that allows one to measure the vector momenta of several ions and electrons resulting from atomic or molecular fragmentation. In a unique combination, large solid angles close to 4π and superior momentum resolutions around a few per cent of an atomic unit (a.u.) are typically reached in state-of-the art machines, so-called reaction-microscopes. Evolving from recoil-ion and cold target recoil-ion momentum spectroscopy (COLTRIMS), reaction-microscopes—the `bubble chambers of atomic physics'—mark the decisive step forward to investigate many-particle quantum-dynamics occurring when atomic and molecular systems or even surfaces and solids are exposed to time-dependent external electromagnetic fields.

This paper concentrates on just these latest technical developments and on at least four new classes of fragmentation experiments that have emerged within about the last five years. First, multi-dimensional images in momentum space brought unprecedented information on the dynamics of single-photon induced fragmentation of fixed-in-space molecules and on their structure. Second, a break-through in the investigation of high-intensity short-pulse laser induced fragmentation of atoms and molecules has been achieved by using reaction-microscopes. Third, for electron and ion-impact, the investigation of two-electron reactions has matured to a state such that the first fully differential cross sections (FDCSs) are reported. Fourth, comprehensive sets of FDCSs for single ionization of atoms by ion-impact, the most basic atomic fragmentation reaction, brought new insight, a couple of surprises and unexpected challenges to theory at keV to GeV collision energies. In addition, a brief summary on the kinematics is provided at the beginning. Finally, the rich future potential of the method is briefly envisaged.}

The non-perturbative influence of the laser field manifests itself in a number of ways: resonance positions shift as a function of intensity, and the widths of both bound-state and autoionizing resonances increase due to their increased photoionization. We demonstrate that even at relatively modest intensities the widths of some low-lying autoionizing states are dominated by photoionization.}

	Abstract = {Progress in ultrafast science allows for probing quantum superposition states with ultrashort laser pulses in the new regime where several linear and nonlinear ionization pathways compete. Interferences of pathways can be observed in the photoelectron angular distribution and in the past they have been analyzed for atoms and molecules in a single quantum state via anisotropy and asymmetry parameters. Those conventional parameters, however, do not provide comprehensive tools for probing superposition states in the emerging research area of bright and ultrashort light sources, such as free-electron lasers and high-order harmonic generation. We propose a new set of generalized asymmetry parameters which are sensitive to interference effects in the photoionization and the interplay of competing pathways as the laser pulse duration is shortened and the laser intensity is increased. The relevance of the parameters is demonstrated using results of state-of-the-art numerical solutions of the time-dependent Schr{\"o}dinger equation for ionization of helium atom and neon atom.},

    abstract = { Nonequilibrium processes involving electronic and vibrational degrees of freedom in nanoscale materials are under active experimental investigation. Corresponding theoretical studies are much scarcer. The review starts with the basics of time-dependent density functional theory, recent developments in nonadiabatic molecular dynamics, and the fusion of the two techniques. Ab initio simulations of this kind allow us to directly mimic a great variety of time-resolved experiments performed with pump-probe laser spectroscopies. The focus is on the ultrafast photoinduced charge and exciton dynamics at interfaces formed by two complementary materials. We consider purely inorganic materials, inorganic-organic hybrids, and all organic interfaces, involving bulk semiconductors, metallic and semiconducting nanoclusters, graphene, carbon nanotubes, fullerenes, polymers, molecular crystals, molecules, and solvent. The detailed atomistic insights available from time-domain ab initio studies provide a unique description and a comprehensive understanding of the competition between electron transfer, thermal relaxation, energy transfer, and charge recombination processes. These advances now make it possible to directly guide the development of organic and hybrid solar cells, as well as photocatalytic, electronic, spintronic, and other devices relying on complex interfacial dynamics. }

abstract = "Nonsequential double ionization is theoretically investigated in the counter-rotating two-color [frequencies (ω1,ω2)] circularly polarized laser fields with classical ensemble approach. It is found that remarkable ionization enhancement is obtained by adjusting the relative electric field amplitude ratios (γE). The result indicates that there is a broader steerable range of γE to obtain higher ionization enhancement for ω2=3ω1 than that for ω2=2ω1. Through the analysis of trajectories, the recollision picture for ω2=3ω1 is complicated leading to slow change of double ionization, which is benefit to gentle control mechanism. However, the recollision ionization channel is easily distinguishable and sensitive to control double ionization in ω2=2ω1 laser fields and the travel time can be controlled in the order of magnitude of 100 attoseconds."}

Extensively exploited HHG technology has, however, a few unsolved problems, where producing of circularly polarized or chiral attosecond pulses belongs to them. We have demonstrated experimentally a way to control the ellipticity of attosecond pulse trains produced via HHG in two-color, bi-circular laser fields. We show that the combination of a nonlinear medium position and the intensities of the two-color driving laser fields create an effective helicity-dependent filter. Based on this approach, we report generation of chiral spectra providing potential to produce attosecond pulses with polarization tuned from the rotating, but linear to highly elliptic, with ellipticity as much as \&\#x03F5;$=$0.75. This new way to create a chiral-sensitive element offers a simple and practical knob to control polarization for a combined harmonics field in a smooth and predictable manner.},

Our numerical simulations show that the pulse duration is limited by fourth-order dispersion and that shorter pulses will be possible if this can be reduced. Also, by inserting a pellicle in various positions in a Ti:sapphire cavity, we have measured the intracavity pulse duration and chirp of the circulating pulse in the laser. Our results demonstrate that the pulse is shortest near the middle of the laser crystal, in one direction of propagation. In the other direction of propagation, the pulse is positively chirped and several times longer.},
