The development of ultrashort laser pulses with durations of a few tens of attoseconds (1as = 10^{−18}s) has opened the possibility of observing and controlling the motion of electrons in matter at their natural time scale. However, the broad spectral bandwidth of the pulses leads to several pathways interfere during the ionization process. 
I will present my studies on understanding the impacts of short pulses on atomic ionization, the generalized asymmetry parameters we developed, and a method for reconstructing electronic wavepackets undergoing attosecond motion. Additionally, I will touch on Rydberg state excitation by intense IR laser pulses and my work towards solving the TDSE numerically for two fully correlated electrons in a potential interacting with a laser pulse.
