The development of ultrashort laser pulses with durations of a few tens of attoseconds (1 as = $10^{âˆ’18}$ s) has opened the possibility of observing and controlling the motion of electrons in matter at their natural time scale. However, the broad spectral bandwidth of the pulses pose the challenge that several linear and nonlinear pathways compete and interfere during the interaction of those pulses with the target. 
In this thesis defense, I will present my studies on understanding the impacts of short pulses on atomic ionization, the generalized asymmetry parameters (GAPs) we developed to study ionization of electrons in superpositions, and a method for reconstructing electronic wavepackets undergoing attosecond motion. Additionally, I will touch on Rydberg state excitation by intense IR laser pulses and my work towards solving the time-dependent Schrodinger equation (TDSE) numerically for two fully correlated electrons in an atomic potential interacting with intense ultrashort pulses.
